- Participated in a 24 hour hack-a-thon focussed on predicting next vacation destination for American Airlines passengers.
- Analyzed 2 datasets containing passenger demographics and vacation destination preference to develop predictive models and enhance travel recommendations.
- Utilized pandas and numpy libraries to perform data transformations, EDA and joins.
- Applied advanced analytics concepts by using seaborn, matplotlib libraries to generate visualizations to understand the distribution of the column data points.
- Predictors were selected based on correlation analysis to remove multicollinear features and retain the most relevant variables for the model.
- Enhanced modeling performance by improving R2 score from 50% to 75% through the use of ANN model.
- Delivered actionable insights to stakeholders through clear and impactful presentations.
